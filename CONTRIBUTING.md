Contributions to this project are very appreciated, though we require some formalisms:
<ol>
    <li>
        You are not required to explain everything you did inside code comments. But when you are creating code that spans between multiple files, or it requires more than basic knowledge to be understood, help everyone understand what you are doing by leaving small comments inside your code or by explaining the stream of consciousness inside the pull request.
    </li>
    <li>
        When creating a pull request, point to an issue or explain what you did using few words (this is an extension of what was said in rule 1).
    </li>
    <li>
        Not following step 1 and step 2, will not exclude your contribution but it will slow the development process because we will have to make questions before accepting your request.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will not accept contributions containing <i>shady code</i> or any form of <i>crime</i>.<br>
        Examples of <i>shady code</i> is, but not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                References and links to servers we don't own or that are not certified
            </li>
            <li>
                Exposing users to external or internal vulnerabilities
            </li>
            <li>
                Using code tricks to bypass privileges or access reserved memory areas
            </li>
        </ul>
        Examples of <i>crimes</i> are, but not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Discrimination based on ethnicity, sex, religion, physical aspect, sexual orientation or any other individual right protected by Human Rights or by simple logic and maturity
            </li>
            <li>
                Cybercrimes
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        It's not mandatory, but try to follow the already existing code indentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Since we believe in a friendly enviroment, memes are permitted in comments. Just don't abuse them and respect rule 4.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can contribute using your licensed code, though we will have to check few things before:
        <ol>
            <li>
                You are the real author
            </li>
            <li>
                The contribution respects rule 4
            </li>
            <li>
                If you propose someone else's code to be integrated, the integration will have to respect the author's needs and will. Basically we have to respect its license.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Last but not the least, no one on this planet is born knowning everything. If you respect all the rules above but your pull request is rejected because of the nature of your code, your contribution will not be vain. Your help may give someone else ideas, or the possibility to refactor your code and make it more readable. This is the meaning of open source. Also remember that even us, the creators, started all of this knowing almost nothing, so don't be afraid to be judged.
